### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A self-taught Web Developer focusing on Front End Engineering. I work with (Html,Css,VanillaJS,React) to make modern, responsive and accessible websites that satisfy a company's needs . My way of learning a new language/technology is being project-based so every line of code simulate working on a real-life project and not depending on one resource, so I go through a "lot of details" curriculum to make sure I'm not missing any important information then googling a specific topic if it wasn't that clear for me through the curriculum's explanation. My main focus while learning (still learning) is on algorithms and problem-solving skill, because technology changes and evolves, but this is not a problem for a mind that has faced many problems and is used to logical thinking. A friendly environment(local/remote) will be good for me, because I'm social and like to meet interesting people.A self-taught Web Developer focusing on Front End Engineering.
